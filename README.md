### Hi There! I'm Nepster

### I'm a programming student  💻 (in Brazil 🌎)

<p> 👤 At the moment I am 19 years old, I would like to have realized how much I ❤️ to program and solve problems before, maybe today I would be much more evolved, anyway I have been studying hard and working hard to learn more about the subject, I really believe in work hard and I do it, it is also valid for studies, only in this way I will reach my goals, although I am unable to understand much now, I am studying for this and I need experience, so please invite me to assist in the development of any project ( even without pay, my focus now is to learn).</p>

📚 I am learning JavaScript and web development, but I am very interested in mobile and python development.
